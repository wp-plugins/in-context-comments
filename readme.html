"In-Context Comment" lets readers leave comments right next to the content being commented, instead of only at the bottom of the blog post
<p align="left"><h3>Description</h3></p>
Comments are extremely critical for the success of a blog. All existing blog platform and commenting plugins only let readers add comments all the way at the bottom
of a post, out of the context of the content in the post. When you write a long blog post with, say, 10 paragraphs, and readers are commenting on a particular statement 
or expression in paragraph 3, they have to scroll back and forth to read the context to figure out what the comments are about. The "In-Context Comment" 
plugin changes that: Now you can add an "In-Context Comment" icon using <b>&lt;in-context-comment:here:tag&gt;</b> (where "tag" is any word or words connected by hyphen ) 
at any place you want readers to comment on and they will be able to click and open a window to add comments right there, next to the context so other readers can see both 
the context and the comments in one glance. The comment window automatically closes when a reader clicks the cursor anywhere outside the comment window so it does not 
interfere with the reading.
<p align="left">This plugin can also help you grow your readership by posting the comments to the commenters' Facebook and Twitter status updates to bring in new readers to your blog.</p>

You can also configure the "In-Context Comment" plugin to automatically add a comment icon at the end of each paragraph that is longer than a certain number of characters. This auto feature is enabled by default with a minimum character count of 360. Please go to the plugin¡¯s Settings page to change.

<p align="left"><h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3></p>
How to use In-Context Comment?
<ol>
<li>First make sure you have activated this plugin.</li>
<li>You have complete control on where add "In-Context Comment" icons in each blog post using the following three commands:
<ol style="text-align: left;" type="a">
<li>Add <b>&lt;in-context-comment:auto-on&gt;</b> anywhere in a blog post (in HTML edit mode) to turn on the function to automatically add  an In-Context Comment icon at the end of each paragraph that is longer than a certain number of characters (see command below). The auto mode is on by default for all posts. You can use <b>&lt;in-context-comment:auto-off&gt;</b> to turn this function off in a post you don't want in context comments.</li>
<li><b>&lt;in-context-comment:block-size:N&gt;</b> where N is a positive integer, e.g., 350. When the auto mode is on, this command controls the minimum number of characters a paragraph must have for an In-Context Comment icon to be added at the end of the paragraph. This is to avoid adding icons to a very short paragraph.</li>
<li><b>&lt;in-context-comment:here:tag&gt;</b> where "tag" is any word or words connected by hyphen, e.g., first-comment. You can add this command at any place inside a post where you want readers to leave comments. This command works regardless whether the auto mode is on or off.</li>
</ol>
<li>When the auto mode is on, if you need to edit a post, in the HTML edit mode, you will see a command <b>&lt;in-context-comment:autotag&gt;</b> (where autotag is an auto generated tag for the icon) at the location of each  In-Context Comment icon. You can cut and paste the command <b>&lt;in-context-comment:autotag&gt;</b> to move the comment to any place in the post. </li>
<li>In the plugin's configuration page, you can turn on/off the auto mode and change the minimum block-size globally for all posts. The configuration here will apply to all posts unless you use the commands above to change it for an individual post.</li>
</ol>
Note: This plugin will only affect new posts you write after the installation.
